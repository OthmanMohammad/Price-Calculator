# Price Calculator

This project is a C# implementation of a price calculator, which can perform the following operations on a list of products:

- Calculate taxes based on a given tax rate.
- Apply discounts based on a given discount rate or specific UPC discounts.
- Apply expenses based on a percentage or monetary value.
- Apply a cap to the final price.

## Familiarity with C#

This project assumes familiarity with the C# programming language, particularly object-oriented programming concepts like classes, interfaces, and inheritance. It also assumes familiarity with the .NET Framework and Visual Studio, as the project is built using these technologies.

## Program.cs

The `Program.cs` file contains sample code demonstrating how to use the price calculator to perform various operations on a list of products. The following operations are demonstrated:

- Calculating taxes on a product.
